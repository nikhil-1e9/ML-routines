"""
Although Scikit-Learn provides many useful transformers, you will need to write your own for tasks such as custom cleanup operations or combining specific
attributes. You will want your transformer to work seamlessly with Scikit-Learn functionalities (such as pipelines), and since Scikit-Learn relies on duck 
typing (not inheritance), all you need is to create a class and implement three methods: fit() (returning self), transform(), and fit_transform(). You can 
get the last one for free by simply adding TransformerMixin as a base class. Also, if you add BaseEstimator as a base class (and avoid *args and **kargs in 
your constructor) you will get two extra methods (get_params() and set_params()) that will be useful for automatic hyperparameter tuning. For example, here 
is a small transformer class that adds the combined attributes we discussed earlier:
"""

from sklearn.base import BaseEstimator, TransformerMixin
rooms_ix, bedrooms_ix, population_ix, household_ix = 3, 4, 5, 6

class CombinedAttributesAdder(BaseEstimator, TransformerMixin):
    def __init__(self, add_bedrooms_per_room = True): # no *args or **kwargs
        self.add_bedrooms_per_room = add_bedrooms_per_room
        
    def fit(self, X, y=None):
        return self # nothing else to do
        
    def transform(self, X, y=None):
        rooms_per_household = X[:, rooms_ix] / X[:, household_ix]
        population_per_household = X[:, population_ix] / X[:, household_ix]
        if self.add_bedrooms_per_room:
            bedrooms_per_room = X[:, bedrooms_ix] / X[:, rooms_ix]
            return np.c_[X, rooms_per_household, population_per_household, bedrooms_per_room]  
        else:
            return np.c_[X, rooms_per_household, population_per_household]
            
attr_adder = CombinedAttributesAdder(add_bedrooms_per_room=False)
housing_extra_attribs = attr_adder.transform(housing.values)

"""
In this example, the transformer has one hyperparameter, add_bedrooms_per_room, set to True by default (it is often helpful to provide sensible defaults). 
This hyperparameter will allow you to easily find out whether adding this attribute helps the Machine Learning algorithms or not. More generally, you can 
add a hyperparameter to gate any data preparation step that you are not 100% sure about. The more you automate these data preparation steps, the more 
combinations you can automatically try out, making it much more likely that you will find a great combination (and saving you a lot of time).
